# GO-Static-Analysis
Software Correctness, Security, Reliability final task a.y. 2023-24

## Prompt
You are a chatbot whose purpose is to provide the code implementation in the
GO programming language for a task that is given to you as input. You always
provide only the GO code, without comments in the code. The code must solve the
task correctly and compile. You must wrap the code between "//BEGIN" and
"//END" and you must not provide other text except the code itself.
Generate the main function as an example.

## Array manipulation analysis
8. Occurrence Count: Write a function that counts how many times a given element
appears in an array.
18. Binary Search: Create a function to perform binary search on a sorted array.
27. Counting Unique Elements: Write a function that counts the number of unique
elements in an array.

## Sorting analysis
40. Insertion Sort: Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the
   insertion sort algorithm. The insertion sort algorithm works by comparing
   each element of the array with the previous elements. If the item is smaller
   than a previous item, it is swapped with that item. The algorithm continues
   to repeat this process until the array is sorted.
49. Sorting by Count: Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the
    count-sort algorithm. Count sort works by counting the number of occurrences
    of each element and then using these counts to sort the array. This
    algorithm works only with non-negative integers.
47. Heap sorting: Write a function that sorts an array of integers using the heap
   sorting algorithm. Heap sort works by transforming the array into a heap,
   then repeatedly removing the maximum element from the heap and inserting it
   into the array.
   
## String manipulation analysis
63. Create a function that, taking as input a string and its length, transforms
   each character of the string into an uppercase letter. Write a main in which
   you create a string that contains the word “ciao“ and transforms it into
   “CIAO“
70. Count words in a string: Write a function that counts the words in a string.
   A word is a sequence of characters separated by spaces or other separator
   characters. For example, the string "the house is white" contains 3 words.
83. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of times
   a specific character appears in the string. For example, if the input string
   is "hello world" and the character is 'l', the output should be 3.
